# Health-Track-Pro-Plus
In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, the integration of technology plays a pivotal role in enhancing patient care and revolutionizing the way medical data is managed. In this assignment, we delve into the creation of a sophisticated healthcare system, “HealthTrack Pro Plus”, designed to collect, store, analyze, and present crucial patient data. This innovative system amalgamates cutting-edge sensor technology, RFID card data, web development using Node.js, SQLite database management, and the power of machine learning. HealthTrack Pro Plus is not merely a data repository; it is a comprehensive solution that not only captures essential health metrics like heart rate and body temperature but also incorporates patient-specific details through RFID cards. This amalgamation of sensor data and patient information forms the foundation upon which our system operates.

Furthermore, HealthTrack Pro Plus goes a step beyond conventional healthcare systems by incorporating a machine learning model. This model harnesses the potential of advanced algorithms to analyze the collected data, seeking intricate patterns and correlations. The utilization of machine learning adds a layer of intelligence to the system, providing healthcare professionals with actionable insights into patient health trends.
Throughout this assignment, we explore the intricate components of HealthTrack Pro Plus, detailing its architecture, data flow, integration of machine learning, and methods of data presentation. By addressing the complexities of data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization, this assignment showcases a holistic approach to healthcare informatics. In an era where data-driven decision-making is paramount, HealthTrack Pro Plus stands as an exemplar of how technology can be harnessed to transform healthcare delivery, ensuring a healthier and more informed future for patients and medical professionals alike.

Data Collection:

Sensors Data:
 - Heart Rate
 - Body Temperature

RFID Card Data:
 - Patient Name
 - Patient National ID Frequent Sickness

Data Storage:

 - Database: SQLite database is used to store the collected data. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that is suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

Web Application (NodeJS):

 - Backend: Node.js is used as the backend framework. It handles the logic of receiving data from sensors and RFID cards, processing it, storing it in the SQLite database,
and feeding it to the machine learning model for analysis.

 - Frontend: The frontend of the web application is responsible for displaying the processed data to both the admin and the client. It integrates Chart.js to create visually appealing and interactive charts.


Machine Learning Integration:

 - Machine Learning Model: A machine learning model is integrated into the system. This model utilizes the collected health data for analysis, aiming to find patterns and correlations within the data.

 - Data Feeding: The collected sensor and RFID data are fed into the machine learning model for analysis. The model processes this data to identify trends, anomalies, and potential health patterns.

 - Analysis Outputs: The results of the machine learning analysis can be displayed through the web application. Admins can gain insights into patient health trends, enabling proactive healthcare management.

 Data Presentation:

 - Tabular Display: The collected data can be shown in tabular form, providing a structured and organized view of the data.

 - Chart.js: Chart.js is used to create visually appealing and interactive charts based on the analysis results. These charts provide a graphical representation of health trends and patterns identified by the machine learning model.

 Workflow:

Data Collection:
 - Sensors collect heart rate and body temperature data from the patient. RFID card provides patient information including name, national ID, and frequent sickness data.

Data Storage:
 - The collected data is sent to the Node.js backend.
Node.js processes the data and stores it in the SQLite database.

 - Machine Learning Analysis:
The stored data is fed into the integrated machine learning model.
The model analyzes the data to identify patterns and correlations related to the patient's health.
​
Data Presentation:
 - The machine learning analysis results can be displayed in the web application. Admins and patients can view the processed data, including tabular representations and interactive charts generated using Chart.js, providing valuable insights into the patient's health status and trends.
